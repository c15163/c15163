# Hi, I'm Hyesung Ji
Machine Learning • Reinforcement Learning • Computer Vision • Optimization

I build reproducible machine learning experiments, implement reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch, and analyze classical papers through clean, fully-documented code.

## Current Focus
Reinforcement Learning (MDP, TD(λ), DQN)  
Computer Vision (CNN-based digit detection)  
Supervised & Unsupervised Learning  
Optimization & Search Algorithms  
Reproducible ML systems and experiment pipelines  

## Featured Projects

Implementation and analysis of the classic TD(λ) algorithm used in Sutton’s temporal-difference learning paper.

### 2. Markov Decision Processes: VI, PI, Q-Learning
From-scratch implementations of value iteration, policy iteration, and Q-learning across grid and non-grid environments.

### 3. Reproducing DQN (Mnih et al. 2015) on LunarLander-v2
Analysis of ε-decay schedules and target-network update frequencies with reproducible experiment code.

### 4. CNN-Based Digit Detection and Classification
Multi-scale MSER with a custom CNN/VGG classifier for digit region detection and classification.

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering Benchmark
Comparison of PCA, ICA, Random Projection, and LLE combined with clustering and neural-network classification.

### 6. Randomized Optimization Algorithms
Analysis of Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithms, and MIMIC across multiple search landscapes.
